            <h1>1. Introduction to Ayurveda</h1>
            <p>Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that originated in India thousands of years ago. It is a holistic approach to healthcare that focuses on achieving balance and harmony in the body, mind, and spirit to promote overall well-being.it is a Sanskrit term meaning "science of life," and encompasses a comprehensive understanding of health, focusing on the harmonious balance of the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is deeply rooted in the belief that the human body is interconnected with the natural elements and the universe, and maintaining this balance is essential for overall well-being.
            The core philosophy of Ayurveda revolves around the principles of prevention and promotion of health rather than merely treating diseases.

            <h1>2. Concept of Prakriti</h1>
            <p> Prakriti refers to an individual's unique constitution or natural state. It is determined at the time of birth and is a combination of the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Understanding one's Prakriti is crucial in Ayurveda for personalized health management. The Concept of Prakriti refers to the inherent and unique constitution of an individual, determining their physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. Derived from the Sanskrit word "Prakriti," meaning nature, this concept is foundational to the personalized approach of Ayurvedic medicine.Prakriti reflects the harmonious interplay of the doshas, contributing to an individual's overall health and well-being.While Prakriti provides a baseline, Ayurveda acknowledges that external factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences can temporarily disturb the doshic balance. This dynamic nature allows for adjustments in Ayurvedic practices to address changing health needs and maintain overall equilibrium.Ayurveda encourages individuals to adopt lifestyle choices and practices that support and enhance their inherent doshic balance, thereby preventing the onset of diseases.
